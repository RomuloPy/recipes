Ingredients in baked chicken nuggets
Not only is this healthy baked chicken nuggets recipe quick to make, dairy free, perfectly spiced and requires minimal ingredients that you might even have in your kitchen right now! Here’s what you’ll need:

Chicken: I use boneless, skinless chicken breast and cut it into 1 inch cubes.
Breadcrumbs: the outside of the chicken nuggets get nice and crispy thanks to panko breadcrumbs!
Olive oil cooking spray: using cooking spray is a KEY to the crispy outside as well. You’ll learn why below.
Spices: these chicken nuggets get their flavor from onion powder, paprika, a bit of cayenne pepper (if you like a little heat), garlic powder, salt & pepper.
Eggs & milk: you’ll need both to help the breadcrumbs stick to the cubes of chicken. I used almond milk to keep the recipe dairy free!
Dipping sauces: have fun with aaall of the sauces like honey mustard (try the homemade one in this recipe!), ketchup or your favorite BBQ sauce for dipping!
